        <p>The <i>Foundation</i> set of libraries is a collection of classes and
            related tools that have been proved to be useful for my daily
            programming work. One goal in writing this code was to use always
            the latest Java, together with the most recent state-of-the-art
            coding techniques. I also put a lot of strength on the
            documentation of my code, so hopefully there are not any questions
            remaining after studying this JavaDoc.</p>
        <p>Another goal when creating this library was to provide JUnit tests
            for all classes and their methods. Unfortunately, this is a work in
            progress, but I am on a good way.</p>
        <p>The <i>util</i> module of the Foundation Library provides several
            general purpose tools and utilities; it is the library to add to
            your project when you want to make use of the <i>Foundation</i>
            libraries.</p>
